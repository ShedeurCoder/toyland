        <h1 class="mb-3">The History of Toyland</h1>
        <small>Kind of in an oversimplified way</small>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 1: The Discovery of the Island</h2>
        <p>On July 1519, Ferdinand Magellan, a Portugese explorer working for the Spanish King, found the island of modern KJ Island. Ferdinand Magellan decided to search for more land around the area and found the island of modern Toyland and modern Kuishi Niku Cheka. Magellan claimed those islands for Spain and went along in his missions. After Magellan's crew returned, Spain was informed of this island and went to govern it and milk the resources out of it.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 2: British Colonisation</h2>
        <p>On August of 1685, the British decided to take the island due to it's abundance in silver. They went to a war with the Spanish that lasted over 12 years, and on Christmas of 1697, the Spanish surrendered the Toyland colony to the British.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 3: Dutch Colonisation</h2>
        <p>35 years after the British took over Toyland, the Dutch wanted it after seeing the British benefiting off of Toyland. The Dutch then fought a brutal 4 year war and won the island.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 4: Lead up to the Kuishi Revolution</h2>
        <p>During the Spanish, British, and Dutch occupation of the islands, the tribes there were very much angry due to how the colonisers treated them. Especially during the Dutch times, the Leg;os (semicolon before a vowel means the vowel after the semicolon has an accent on it.) Tribe was forced to be slaves to harvest their stuff. All tribes in the island, whether enemies or not, had a common enemy. As more and more tensions grew with harder governing and oppression, the people finally snapped and built an army led by the strongest tribe, the Leg;os.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 5: The Small Town Protest</h2>
        <p>On July 1st, 1771, the Leg;os tribe decided to start a protest in the island's capital, Small Town. They brought a few guns just in case they had to defend themselves. They protested the harsh oppresion the Dutch gave them. After around 2 hours of loud protesting, the Dutch military started driving them home by peacefull means. The protestors didn't want to go home, and so the Dutch started firing.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 6: The First Battle of the Revolution</h2>
        <p>After the Dutch started firing, the mission was clear: Fire back at the Dutch. The Leg;os started firing back while trying to find a safe place to put the children. Every single person in the protest was ordered to fire at the Dutch. This firing lasted from 11:42 to 15:23 (3:23 PM). A total of 200 people died on both sides, with almost 400 injured.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 7: Declaration of Independence</h2>
        <p>Following the first battle, the Leg;os leaders decided it was a good idea to declare independence from the Dutch. And on August 2nd, 1771, the nation of the United Tribes of Toyland was formed.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 8: Niku Cheka</h2>
        <p>Niku Cheka IV was the Leg;os leader during the revolution, and the highest general order during the war. His father, Niku Cheka III, was the Leg;os leader before him and always believed in freedom from the colonisers. Niku Cheka also believed in his father, and wanted independence from the Dutch.
        </p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 9: The Establishment of a Confederacy</h2>
        <p>After the Declaration of Independence was released, on November 8th 1771, Niku Cheka held a meeting with all tribe leaders in the island. They decided when they get their independence, the United Tribes of Toyland would act as a confederacy, with the tribes having more power than the central acting government.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 10: The Second Battle of Small Town</h2>
        <p>Almost 2 years after the first battle in Small Town, the town was a thriving capital for Toyland. That is, until the Dutch started the soon to be a 4 month battle. It was the bloodiest battle of the entire war, with over 50,000 deaths on the Dutch side and 74,000 deaths on the Toyland side. The battle ended in a Toyland victory when they sent a spy to the Dutch to sabotage their system, allowing them to make a surprise attack towards their back. The battle ended in August 2, 1773, on independence day.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 11: The Assasination of Niku Cheka</h2>
        <p>On the night of the 7th of July, 1773, during the battle of Small Town, Dutch soldiers snuck into Niku Cheka's house, broke in, and shot him to death. After such horror, Niku Cheka's 19 year old son, Niku Cheka V, took charge of the Leg;os tribe and became leader of the army.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 12: The End of the War</h2>
        <p>On November 3rd, 1775, the last batle of the war was about to happen. The battle of Legoland was officially triggered when a Dutch soldier shot and killed 5 Toyland soldiers, causing an escalation to a full on battle. Due to the battle ground being near a cliff beach, the Toylanders formed a plan to push the Dutch to the cliff. They organized troops from Small Town to march their way into Legoland to help. They also got some people from the P;inip'on tribe to help in the battle. On November 17th, 1775, the Dutch were surrounded by Toyland soldiers and the cliff beach at the back. At this point, the Dutch were very low in their economy, with over 600 billion modern USD being spent on this war. General Bared Janses of the Dutch army decided to surrender when some of his men were already pushed down the cliff beach.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 13: The New Nation</h2>
        <p>After the battle of Legoland, the Dutch agreed to give Toyland independence. On November 20, 1775, the negotiations were over and the Dutch flag was flown down, replaced by a Toyland flag.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 14: The King</h2>
        <p>After independence, Niku Cheka was a hero to Toyland. They renamed the island of Ma;u'i' to Kuishi Niku Cheka. They even gave him the island and said he is the king of that island as well as the Leg;os. After a few months though, Niku Cheka became power hungry, and invaded neighboring tribes. This started the Niku Cheka Era.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 15: Brand New Colonisers</h2>
        <p>On Independence day of 1776, the Toylanders found themselves being colonised yet again. Not by western powers, but by themselves. King Niku Cheka V I (not a 6, instead he is Niku Cheka V, but the first Niku Cheka king.) has taken over all of Toyland and called it the Kingdom of Kuishi Niku Cheka.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 16: Back to the Dark Ages</h2>
        <p>Just as the Toylanders got their independence, they were once again back to their dark ages. Any tribe that wasn't a Leg;os were forced to be a slave or be executed. Now even worse than the Dutch, the Toylanders were very heartbroken that their great hero had turned to the dark side.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 17: The Second Small Town Protest</h2>
        <p>On July 1, 1781, 10 years after the Small Town Protest, a young 19 year old advocate for Toyland independence went to the streets of Small Town and started protesting. He was later joined by his friends, and his friend's friends, and so on. Eventually, after a day of protesting, 100 individuals were along side the advocate. The Kuishi military was ordered to send them home after a few more hours of protesting. The advocate, knowing how bloody it will be if they didn't go home, told his friends to go home immediatly.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 18: The Young Advocate</h2>
        <p>The young advocate that started the protest went by Barney Dog. Dog would dreamed about being free from any colonisers, as he had 10 years ago as a part of the first protest. When he ordered the protest, he was very grumpy, hence getting his nickname: Grumpy Dog.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 19: The First Battle of the Toyland Revolution</h2>
        <p>On August 2, 1781, Grumpy Dog and 500 other pro-independence individuals from Small Town signed a petition to give Toyland its independence. They sent the petition, named the Petition of Partition, to Niku Cheka. 2 days after they sent it, in the middle of the night of August 7, 1781 in Small Town, gunshots were heard. People woke up from the noise, seeing Kuishi soldiers killing those who signed the petition. Grumpy Dog grabbed his father's gun without permission, rallied the rest of the signers, and fought against the Kuishis. The Toylanders, vastly outnumbered, fought bravely and hardly against the Kuishis. After about an hour of fighting, about 1000 other Small Town Residents who had a gun went to join the battle. When over 800 Small Townians died, they retreated, leaving the Kuishis in a victory. Grumpy Dog however did not give up.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 20: Declaration of Independence Part 2</h2>
        <p>On August 10, 1781, Grumpy Dog and 90% of Small Town's population signed the brand new Declaration of Independence. The Governer General of Small Town also secretly signed the document. 2 days later, word was spread that Small Town declared independence form Kuishi. Soon, other colonies joined. And on August 22, 1781, every colony joined the brand new Republic of the United Toyland.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 21: The Battle of Toy Central City</h2>
        <p>After 5 years of fighting, General Grumpy Dog ordered an advance into Toy Central City on October 7th 1785. Toy Central City was the location of the Kuishi Defence Ministry of the Toyland Island. This placed housed all important governing areas, plans, soldiers, etc. When Grumpy Dog ordered the advance, soldiers from all 6 sides met around the city and violently pushed in. After a few pushbacks, they took over 45% of the city, reaching the Kuishi Defence Ministry. When they were marching towards it, over 50,000 Kuishi soldiers started attacking the 30,000 Toyland soldiers. Following a few hours of battling, Grumpy Dog sent a message to other colonies to send troops over. And on the 25th of October, Toyland had almost 75,000 soldiers at the battle. Kuishi, having lost 15,000 soldiers already, had to do something. Kuishi fought more violently, throwing poisonous gasses into the air. On November 1, both Kuishi and Toyland suffered greatly with only around 5,000 soldiers left each. Toyland wanted to sue for peace, but Kuishi wouldn't allow it. Niku Cheka ordered more drafting and training, and a whopping 200,000 soldiers will be sent. Toyland also got more men to volunteer, and had an army of over 150,000.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 22: The Battle of Toy Central City Part 2</h2>
        <p>When all of the soldiers arrived, the next that came were 5 bloody months. After those 5 months, with a total of 6 months of fighting, over 352,000 people were killed. Kuishi, having only 4,000 men left, and no resources, surrendered to Toyland on May 17th, 1786. The war was devastating to both sides, with over 500,000 deaths overall, 350,000 if them coming from one battle alone.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 23: Negotiations</h2>
        <p>Kuishi did not want to let go of the colonies, so they were trying to negotiate to still have a bit of power over it. Grumpy Dog kept trying to push for full independence. But eventually, after 2 weeks of negotiations, Grumpy Dog and the rest of Toyland won.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 24: The Republic of the United Toyland</h2>
        <p>After the war, Toyland tried to become great again. Trading with foreign nations, and trying reforms. The first president of the nation, Grumpy Dog (who was also the youngest at only 25), did major reforms to help Toyland survive. Ultimatley, after 40 years and 5 presidents, Toyland was a thriving nation of wealth and happiness.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 25: The Election of 1830</h2>
        <p>On November 3rd, 1830, the presidential election was about to be held for the 6th president. It seamed that the popular Legolander by the name of Jorgen Wurtz would win. And on November 10th, 1830, the newspapers read about the new president: Jorgen Wurtz.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 26: Early Days of Jorgen Wurtz's Administration</h2>
        <p>After Wurtz was elected, he did a lot of good things, like making healthcare cheap, making school free, strengthening relations with other countries, etc. 4 years later, because of what he accomplished, the people chose to re-elect him.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 27: Wurtz's second term</h2>
        <p>Following the election of 1834, Wurtz started getting power-hungry ideas. In congress, he fired everyone against him, and held fake elections for congress in which all the candidates are for him.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 28: Re-writing the Constitution</h2>
        <p>On July 8, 1835, Wurtz anounced that Congress has approved of his new Toyland Constitution, and that it will be in place today. The Constitution gave Wurtz power to be dictator for life, giving the power to his children when he died.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 29: The Christmas War</h2>
        <p>On December 25, 1835, Wurtz declared war on Kuishi Niku Cheka, starting the Christams War. Wurtz ordered troops to make a naval landing onto the shore of Kuishi Niku Cheka. After a swift advancement into the island, Wurtz captured the autonomous region of Whodathunk, taking up half of the island, in less than a week. Wurtz blitzkreig'd through the kingdom, and crushed the rebels of the self-declared nation of Moano. After 1 month of fighting, the Kingdom of Kuishi Niku Cheka surrendered to Toyland.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 30: The Wurtz Dark Ages</h2>
        <p>When Wurtz became dictator, he started abusing everything there was to abuse. He ignored human rights, putting people into gulag-like concentration camps if they were to oppose Wurtz. If you broke a law, major or minor, you would be sent to death. If you dared talk about the government in any way but positive (this included neutral), you would be put into slavery for Wurtz and his government.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 31: Talks for a revolution.</h2>
        <p>On October 31, 1862, word spread of people planning a revolution against Wurtz. Wurtz, knowing his position might be in danger, sent every person who knew about rumours of a revolution were immediatley sent to the concentration camps. Unfortunatley for Wurtz, they did not capture the master-minds of the revolution that was soon to commence.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 32: The Legoland Wall</h2>
        <p>Wurtz, knowing that at any time a revolution could start, began on a project to protect Legoland, his biggest stronghold. He decided to make a giant wall, 10 meters tall, all around the state. The project took 2 years of 24 hour work to complete, but once it was complete, Wurtz was happy.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 33: The start of the revolution</h2>
        <p>On October 30, 1864, Small Town governor John Johnson declared independence from Wurtz, calling the state no longer under Wurtz's rule. He called the new nation "The Republic of Toyland," versus the Wurtz state name of "The Wurtz State of Toyland." Soon after, KJ Island, Stuffed Valley, Kuishi Niku Cheka, Moano, and Whodathunk all joined.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 34: The first battle of the Wurtz revolution</h2>
        <p>Wurtz then sent 3,000 troops each to all states that declared independence. At each border, there was a battle. The Republic of Toyland (ROT) won 3 of the 4 battles, while The Wurtz State of Toyland (WST) won Stuffed Valley.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 35: More support</h2>
        <p>Carland, Tubtoyland, and Dinoville all joined the ROT a few weeks after the first battle. Now, Wurtz was facing the whole Toyland. With only Legoland and Toy Central State (TCS), Wurtz was greatly disadvantaged with population.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 36: The winning of TCS</h2>
        <p>The capital of Toyland was now under siege on all sides but north. The ROT pushed into TCS on all sides. Wurtz evacuated to Legoland and started to move the capital there. After almost 2 months, the ROT reached TCC (Toy Central City), and put it under siege. After fierce battles and 2 weeks later, the ROT won the entirety of TCS.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 37: The battle of Legoland</h2>
        <p>Wurtz's stronghold of Legoland would not last long. After the siege of TCS, Wurtz started panicking. Luckily for Wurtz, the Legoland wall would be very effective in blocking advancements. On July 12, 1865, a siege to Legoland started. Troops advanced from all sides, breaking parts of the wall, causing it to collapse and injure many soldiers. But for the most part, it stopped the troops. Eventually, after 1 month of battling, the ROT controlled the wall and were able to transport freely between the wall. Legoland, being the biggest state of the nation, took a long time to get through. After 6 months of fighting, All fronts met around Legoland City. On January 30, 1866, Wurtz evacuated to a small island off the coast of Kuishi Niku Cheka named Jorgenberg.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 38: The assasination of Jorgen Wurtz</h2>
        <p>Shortly after Wurtz evacuated, a crowd welcomed him on the island, as they were the only allies of Wurtz left. After a while, the crowd heard a loud bang. The crowd realised it was gunshots, and tried to evacuate Wurtz, but it was already too late. The first shot hit Wurtz's head, causing him to die. To this day, Wurtz's killer is still unknown, although people speculate it may be his brother, George Wurtz.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 39: Winning the revolution</h2>
        <p>After the assasination of Jorgen Wurtz, his son, Jorgen Wurtz Jr. took power. Unfortunatley for Wurtz, this made the WST fall into chaos. The ROT was able to capture Legoland on March 4, 1866, and get all of Toyland. Although Toyland won the war, Wurtz declared the nation of Jorgenberg as an independent being.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 40: Jorgenberg</h2>
        <p>Toyland claimed Jorgenberg as their own, but Wurtz claimed it was independent. It would be like this for another 180 years. Ever since Wurtz II, every leader would be the first born son of the previous Wurtz until Wurtz VIII.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Chapter 41: World War I</h2>
